# Creating a simple blog using PHP


## Developing locally
To locally deploy, fork this repository and then, on a folder on your PC enter the following commands (replacing YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with, well, your GitHub username.)

```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/Full-Stack-Development-Course
git pull origin master
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

You will need a web server with PHP execution functionality.
The folder of the git repository should be the document root of the web server.

## Implementing features

When creating a feature, push to your repository and use GitHub's pull request interface to submit a pull request to the original repository. Your pull request will then be reviewed and eventually merged.

## Feature Requests

There is an issue called Suggestions, reply on that with any ideas and suggestions moving forward.

## Bug Reports

In order to submit bug reports, create a new issue. If possible, write a detailed description of the issue and a way to reproduce it.

## Additional

The code has been written in a way that is totally incomplete, and it requires your input to be completed. Comments have been added here and there to help you understand the logic behind certain functions.

##### Stylesheets

If you want to modify the stylesheets, download a LESS autocompile package for your IDE of choice. If using the Atom Editor, you can download [less-compile-on-save](https://atom.io/packages/less-compile-on-save).
